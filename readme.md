### version-manager(vmr)

**vmr** is a simple, cross-platform, and well-tested version manager for programming **languages** and **tools**. It is totally created for general purpose. You don't need any plugins, but just vm. Then everything can be managed.

Maybe you've already heard of **fnm**, **sdkman**, **gvm**, **nvm**, **pyenv**, **phpenv**, etc. However, none of them can manage multiple programming languages. Managers like **asdf-vm** support multiple languages, but only works on unix-like systems, and makes things look complicated. Therefore, **vmr** comes.

### features

- Installs or uninstalls versions of sdk.
- Swithes between versions of sdk.
- Using a version only in current terminal session is supported. See with command **vmr use -h**.
- Handles envs.
- Friendly to VSCoders or Neovimers.
- Downloads files blazingly fast🚀🚀🚀 with multi-threads. See with command **vmr use -h**.
- Auto-completions for shells. See with command **vmr completion -h**.
- Generates command **"vmr use sdk-name@version"** automatically using selected item from version list, and add the command to clipboard for later usage.
- Android development with Flutter and VSCode. No Android Studio is needed.
- No plugins needed.
- More stable.

### How to set a proxy?

**Choose either proxy or reverse-proxy.**

- **proxy**
```bash
vmr set-proxy <http://localhost:port or socks5://localhost:port>
```

- **reverse-proxy**

```bash
# reverse proxy <https://gvc.1710717.xyz/proxy/> is available for free.
vmr set-reverse-proxy https://gvc.1710717.xyz/proxy/
```

- **enable downloading from mirror sites in China**.
```bash
vmr use -mirror-in-china go@1.22.1
```

- **If you're a gopher, you can also complie the project by yourself. The main func is in ./cmd/vmr**

### For Windows

**Note**: If you are using **vmr** on Windows11, you need to enable the **Developer Mode** as **vmr** requires to create symbolic links. If you're on Windows10, and any creating-symbolic-links-failure occurrs, you can try **vmr** with **Admin Privilege**. To get **envs** take effect for windows, you may need to close the current powershell terminal and open a new one. Note that extFAT and FAT32 are not supported. 

To refresh envs on Windows, you may need command **refreshenv**.

**sudo command on Windows**: **gsudo**. You can use **vmr search gsudo** to see what's available.

🛎️🚨 **Virus Positive?**: It's definitely a false positive. See [here](https://forum.golangbridge.org/t/my-compiled-exe-file-is-declared-as-a-virus/34038). If this occurrs, you can install **vmr** manually, and add **vmr** to be trusted.

### Supplementary
**vmr** is created to be a cross-platform command line tool. **We will not try to include everything just like asdf-vm or its imitator vfox did**, as that will greatly increase the complexity and also reduce the possibility of cross-platform. And most of the time, frequently used SDKs and tools have already been covered by **vmr**. **vmr** will not try to include SDKs that need to be compiled under a certain platform. Because each developer's development environment is different, it is impossible to ensure the completion of a compilation. So **vmr** will only use pre-built binaries for installations. If you have any SDKs or tools to recommand for version management, please raise an issue in [Issues](https://github.com/gvcgo/version-manager/issues).

So, **vmr** is going to keep as **lightweight, stable, and user-friendly** as possible.
