### version-manager(vmr)

**vmr** is a simple, cross-platform, and well-tested version manager for programming **languages** and **tools**. It is totally created for general purpose. You don't need any plugins, but just vm. Then everything can be managed.

Maybe you've already heard of **fnm**, **sdkman**, **gvm**, **nvm**, **pyenv**, **phpenv**, etc. However, none of them can manage multiple programming languages. Managers like **asdf-vm** support multiple languages, but only works on unix-like systems, and makes things look complicated. Therefore, **vmr** comes.

### Data flow for vmr

![framwork.png](https://github.com/moqsien/img_repo/raw/main/framework.png)

- [collector](https://github.com/gvcgo/collector) collects version list for SDKs and uploads the results to repo **resources**.
- [resources](https://github.com/gvcgo/resources) Holds the version list for SDKs.
- [vmr](https://github.com/gvcgo/version-manager) The user interface of the whole project.

The collector is deployed on a remote server, which users do never need to know about.
**Vmr** fetches the prepared version list from repo **resources**, and shows/downloads the versions of an SDK.
