### version-manager(vmr)

**vmr** is a simple, cross-platform, and well-tested version manager for programming **languages** and **tools**. It is totally created for general purpose. You don't need any plugins, but just vm. Then everything can be managed.

Maybe you've already heard of **fnm**, **sdkman**, **gvm**, **nvm**, **pyenv**, **phpenv**, etc. However, none of them can manage multiple programming languages. Managers like **asdf-vm** support multiple languages, but only works on unix-like systems, and makes things look complicated. Therefore, **vmr** comes.
